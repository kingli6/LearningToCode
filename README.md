# LearningToCode

Hello!
Jonathan writing. I'm working towards becoming.. Product developer? Haven't figured this part out, to be honest.
I feel there is a wealth of knowledge to be acquired and I am turteling towards it. Any assistance or even a cheer is heavily appreciated. 

What you will find here is C++ Language training and possibly other mess!
