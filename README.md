# LearningToCode
Hello! 
I'm working towards becoming. Product Developer? Haven't figured this part out to be honest. 
I feel there is a wealth of knowledge to be acquired, and I am turtling towards it. Any assistance or even a cheer is heavily appreciated. 
What you will find here is C++ Language training and hopefully other mess! 

Currently employed as a Surveying Engineer in Stockholm, Sweden and making the switch to Computer Science to make my wildest fantasies into reality :D
